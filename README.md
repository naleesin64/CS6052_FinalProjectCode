## CS 6068 Parallel Computing Final Project

The following codes are my non-parallel and MPI parallel codes for the two root-finding methods and two numerical integration methods. 
The codes with MPI parallel speedup has been added an MPI in front of its file name. 

**Note that in order to run mpi4py module, Python version 3.8 is required and Python version 3.9 or above does not work**

I used the following codes to execute the parallel programs
```
mpiexec -n 4 python MPI_*.py
```
